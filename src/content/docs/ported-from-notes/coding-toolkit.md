limitations of the claude gh action is a feature not a bug. we aim to fill the gaps in configuration and workflow with several tools.
```
Limitations and Security Constraints
Despite its advanced capabilities, the Claude Code Action operates within carefully defined limitations designed to maintain security and prevent misuse. Claude cannot submit formal GitHub PR reviews, approve pull requests, or post multiple comments, instead operating through a single updatable comment interface. The system cannot execute arbitrary bash commands by default, requiring explicit tool allowances for specific command execution.

The action cannot access CI/CD systems, test results, or build logs unless specifically configured through additional tools or MCP servers. This limitation ensures that Claude operates within well-defined boundaries while requiring explicit permissions for expanded capabilities. The system also lacks access to repository operations beyond basic file management and commit creation, preventing unauthorized branch manipulation or repository configuration changes.
```

on the interface side of things, i aim to use neovim configured with four key plugins: octo.nvim, neogit, diffview, gitsigns.

a lot of these integrations can be automated with good templating. 

Project Templates

.claude/commands/ for common AI workflows
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ with AI-ready fields
CLAUDE.md with project-specific instructions


Automation Rules

Issue assignment triggers Claude analysis
PR creation invokes review workflow



---

Goal of this project is to establish feedback loops between the tools. For instance, you might create a CLAUDE.md file (which Claude reads for context) that includes your Neogit commit conventions. This ensures Claude's automated commits follow the same patterns you use manually.
You can also use Octo.nvim to create issue templates that work perfectly with Claude. These templates might include sections like "Current Behavior," "Expected Behavior," and "Technical Context" that help Claude understand exactly what needs to be fixed or built.
When reviewing Claude's PRs through Octo.nvim, you can provide feedback that Claude learns from. If Claude's implementation doesn't quite match your architecture, you comment with corrections, and Claude updates the PR. This iterative process happens entirely within your Neovim environment.

Below is a deep dive into how you can leverage **built-in capabilities** of both **Neogit** (the local, Magit-style Git client) and **Octo.nvim** (the GitHub Issues/PR UI) to support:

1. **Conventional Commits**
2. **Release-Please / Semantic Versioning**
3. **Issue ↔ Commit ↔ PR Linking**

…all without leaving Neovim. We’ll cover each plugin in turn, then show how they can interlock with one another (and with an external tool like Release-Please) to create a smooth “issue → commit → PR → automated release” flow.

---

## 1  Neogit: Built-In Functionality for Conventional Commits and Release Workflows

Neogit is primarily a Git client inside Neovim, but it has several “hooks” and workflows you can use to enforce commit conventions, craft PR-ready branches, and prepare for automated releases.

### 1.1  Commit Message Templates

* **Git’s Native `commit.template`:**
  Neogit doesn’t invent its own commit-template system; it simply calls `git commit` under the hood. If you configure a global (or per-repo) template file, Neogit will open that file in its commit buffer automatically.

  1. Create a template file:

     ```bash
     cat > ~/.gitmessage.txt <<EOF
     # Conventional Commit Format
     #
     # <type>(<scope?>): <short description>
     #
     # Types:
     #   feat:     A new feature
     #   fix:      A bug fix
     #   docs:     Documentation only changes
     #   style:    Code style changes (whitespace, formatting)
     #   refactor: Code refactoring without functional changes
     #   perf:     A code change that improves performance
     #   test:     Adding or fixing tests
     #   chore:    Maintenance / build process / auxiliary tools
     #
     # Example:
     #   feat(cli): add `--verbose` flag to `mytool`
     #
     # FOOTER (optional):
     #   BREAKING CHANGE: <description of break>
     #   Issues: <AB#123>, <GH-456>
     EOF
     ```
  2. Tell Git to use that template:

     ```bash
     git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage.txt
     ```
  3. From inside Neovim, run `:Neogit` → press `c c` (commit) → Neogit will open `~/.gitmessage.txt` as the commit buffer.
     You’ll see all the instructions and placeholders already there.
  4. Fill in your `<type>(<scope>): <description>` heading. When you save/quit (`:wq`), Neogit will execute `git commit` with that text.

  **Why this matters:**
  By default, Neogit’s commit buffer includes **everything** you put in the template. You can add comments (lines with `#`) that remind you of the valid “types” and the required footer format. This visually enforces Conventional Commits every time you commit via Neogit.

* **Staging Hunks & Partial Commits:**
  Neogit’s UI allows you to stage individual hunks (`s` to stage, `u` to unstage, even line selections with `v`). This encourages you to create atomic commits—one commit per “feature” or “fix”. When your template is open, you’ll be thinking in “Conventional Commit” terms (“one feature/hunk per commit”), rather than lumping everything together.

---

### 1.2  Pre-Commit Hooks & Commitlint Integration

Neogit itself does not bundle a commit-linting system, but it works seamlessly with any Git hooks you place in `.git/hooks/`. You can integrate **commitlint** (Node/npm-based) or an equivalent shell script to *reject* non-conventional commits:

1. **Install commitlint (for JavaScript/TypeScript or any npm repo):**

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}
   ```

2. **Create a `commitlint.config.js` at your repo root:**

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
   };
   ```

3. **Add a Husky hook (or Lefthook) to run `commitlint` before commit:**

   ```bash
   # with Husky
   npx husky install
   npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"'
   ```

   Or, if you prefer a shell script, create `.git/hooks/commit-msg` with:

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env sh
   commitlint --edit "$1" || {
     echo "✖ Conventional Commit rules not met!"
     exit 1
   }
   ```

   Then `chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg`.

4. **Neogit integration:**

   * You launch a commit inside Neogit, it opens the template.
   * You write: `feat(parser): handle nested arrays`.
   * When you `:wq`, Git invokes the `commit-msg` hook. If it fails, Neogit will show the failure (it pops you back into the COMMIT\_EDITMSG buffer so you can fix it).

This approach means that **every commit you create via Neogit** is guaranteed to follow the Conventional Commits schema.

---

### 1.3  Branch Naming Conventions & Neogit Branch Menu

* **Branch menu (`b`):**
  In Neogit, pressing `b` gives you branch actions. You can customize how new branches are named (e.g., enforce `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/` prefixes).

  ```lua
  require('neogit').setup {
    integrations = {
      diffview = true,
    },
    kind = "tab", -- or "split"
    -- You can add a custom lua function to prompt for branch type
    branch = {
      create_branch_shell = function()
        local commit_type = vim.fn.input("Branch type (feat/fix/chore): ")
        local description = vim.fn.input("Description: ")
        return commit_type .. "/" .. description:gsub("%s+", "-"):lower()
      end
    },
  }
  ```

  Now, when you press `b c` (create branch), Neogit will call your `create_branch_shell` function, prompt:

  ```
  Branch type (feat/fix/chore): feat
  Description: add search filter
  → new branch = feat/add-search-filter
  ```

  This encourages you to name branches in a way that lines up with Conventional Commits.

---

### 1.4  Preparing for Release-Please and Semantic Versions

Neogit itself doesn’t generate releases––Release-Please (or a GitHub Action) does. However, Neogit can help you:

1. **Curate a “release” branch locally:**

   * Use Neogit to ensure that *all* merged PRs on `main` (or `master`) have Conventional Commit-compliant messages.
   * Once you’re ready to cut a release, you can run `:Neogit` → `c` → `c` to create a **cherry-picked** or **squash commit** that summarizes all PRs (e.g., “chore(release):  v1.2.0”).
   * If you use a tool like `git-changelog` or `conventional-changelog`, you might manually generate the changelog in a single commit. Again, Neogit will open the commit buffer, and you can supply the “chore(release): …” header, with a bullet list of changes in the body.

2. **Tagging:**

   * From Neogit’s status buffer, press `b` → `t` (depending on your setup) or run `:!git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "chore(release): v1.2.0"` manually.
   * Push tags via `Neogit` → `Push` → check “Push tags.” This sets up the git side so that a GitHub Action (e.g., Release-Please Action) will pick up the new tag, generate a draft GitHub Release, or update the changelog on merge.

3. **Integration with Diffview for Release PR Review:**

   * After curating your release commit, you’ll likely open a PR on GitHub to bump version files and update `CHANGELOG.md`.
   * Use `:DiffviewOpen main..release-branch` to visually inspect everything you’re about to merge. This ensures that **every merged commit** follows Conventional Commits, which is precisely what Release-Please will parse to build a changelog.

---

### 1.5  Summary: Neogit’s Built-In Leverage Points

* **Commit Buffer + `commit.template`** ⇒ Enforces Conventional Commit structure.
* **Git Hooks (commit-msg) + Neogit** ⇒ Validates each commit automatically.
* **Branch Menu Customization** ⇒ Prompts for branch name prefixes (`feat/`, `fix/`).
* **Diffview Integration** ⇒ Ensures your release PR only contains properly formatted commits.
* **Tagging & Pushing from Neogit** ⇒ Triggers GitHub Actions (or Release-Please) to cut a semantic‐versioned release.

---

## 2  Octo.nvim: Built-In Functionality for Issue Tracking, Linked Commits, and Releases

Whereas Neogit focuses on local Git, **Octo.nvim** connects to GitHub’s Issue & PR APIs. It doesn’t natively do “semantic versioning,” but it provides rich hooks so you can:

1. Link Issues → Conventional Commit branches/commits
2. Create PRs whose titles follow Conventional Commit titles
3. Manage labels/milestones (which feed into Release-Please or project boards)

Below are the main “entry points” in Octo’s built-in feature set that help you drive a Conventional Commit + Release workflow.

---

### 2.1  Issue Creation & Linking to Commits/PRs

* **`:Octo issue create`** opens a buffer with a skeleton issue template. You can add your “type:” (“feat: …” or “chore: …”) in the issue title if you like. But more importantly:

  * You can include a section in your issue template that asks for a “Commit Type” or “Expected Release Type” (patch/minor/major).
  * Example `~/.config/octo/issue_template.md`:

    ```markdown
    ### Description

    <!-- Describe the issue in detail -->

    ### Expected Commit Type
    <!--
    Choose one:
    - feat:     New feature
    - fix:      Bug fix
    - chore:    Maintenance
    -->

    ### Release Level
    <!--
    Choose one:
    - patch
    - minor
    - major
    -->
    ```
  * When you run `:Octo issue create`, Octo loads this template, you fill in the fields, *and you can store metadata in labels* (explained next).

* **Issue Metadata via Labels & Milestones:**

  1. Create labels on GitHub named exactly `type:feat`, `type:fix`, `release:patch`, `release:minor`, `release:major`.
  2. When you create or edit an issue in Octo, press `l` to toggle labels. You can assign exactly one `type:*` label and one `release:*` label.
  3. Later, your Release-Please Action can look at those labels to decide how to bump the version. (If no label is present, default to `patch`.)

* **“Linked Issues” View:**

  * `:Octo issue list involves:@me is:open` will show you every open issue you created/are assigned to/commented on.
  * Once you start working, you open that issue, press `c` → “create branch” (Octo can run a shell command like `git checkout -b feat/ISSUE-123-description` directly).
  * Now your local branch is linked to that issue (naming it by-number helps). If you reference `#123` in your commit, GitHub will auto-link that commit to the issue.

---

### 2.2  PR Creation & Conventional Commit Titles

* **`:Octo pr create`** prompts you for:

  1. **Base** (e.g. `main`)
  2. **Head** (your feature/fix branch)
  3. **PR Title** (default: the branch name)
  4. **PR Body** (you can embed the issue number, e.g., “Closes #123”)

* **Enforcing Conventional Commit Titles in PRs:**

  1. If you name your branch `feat/ISSUE-123-add-auth-flow`, Octo will populate the PR title with that. You can simply edit it to read: `feat(auth): add JWT login`.
  2. Or, in your `.octo_pr_template.md`, force the title to start with `<type>(<scope>): <desc>`. You might store:

     ```markdown
     ## PR Title (use Conventional Commit style)
     <!-- e.g. "fix(parser): handle trailing commas" -->

     ## Description
     <!-- Full PR description, link related issues -->

     Closes #{{issue_number}}
     ```
  3. Octo will open a new buffer for you based on that template. When you save, it calls the GitHub API to create a PR whose title begins with your Conventional Commit heading.

* **Linking Involved Issues:**

  * If your PR description includes `Closes #123`, GitHub will automatically close the issue when merging.
  * Octo also lets you add “linked issues” in the PR metadata view (`I` to toggle “linked issues” sidebar), so you can confirm that the correct issue is referenced for release notes.

---

### 2.3  Labels, Milestones, and Project Boards

* **Labels as “Commit Type” and “Release Level”:**
  When you open an existing issue or PR, press `l` to toggle labels. You can filter your `:Octo issue list` by label, e.g.:

  ```
  :Octo issue list label:type:feat,release:minor is:open
  ```

  This shows “all open feature requests that you expect to be a minor bump.” That metadata can feed directly into a GitHub Action (Release-Please) when you merge.

* **Milestones to Bundle Issues into a Release:**
  If you create a milestone on GitHub called `v1.2.0`, you can from Octo:

  * Open an issue → press `m` → select `v1.2.0`.
  * Now that issue is “tagged for v1.2.0.” When Release-Please runs (either on PR merge or via scheduled job), it looks at all closed issues in `v1.2.0` and composes a changelog section.

* **Project Boards Integration:**
  Octo doesn’t yet render full Kanban columns, but it can:

  1. **Add/remove cards**: When you open an issue or PR, press `P` to open the “Projects” sidebar. You can then press `p` again to add or remove that issue from any project column (if GitHub Projects v2 is in use).

  2. **Move cards**: If your issue is in “To Do” on the project board, you can—with Octo’s `P` → arrow keys → `<Enter>`—move it to “In Progress,” “Review,” or “Done.” This keeps your GitHub Project board synced without leaving Neovim.

  > **Note:** As of mid-2025, Octo’s “project” support is limited to v2 Projects. If you’re on a v1 Classic board, some functionality might not exist. But the ability to assign cards, change columns, and remove cards is there.

---

### 2.4  Reviewing & Merging PRs with Release-Please in Mind

* **PR Checks & Status:**
  Octo shows PR status checks in the right sidebar (`S` to toggle). If Release-Please is configured as a GitHub Action that runs on `push` or `pull_request`, you’ll see “release-please/action” pass/fail. You can only merge once everything is green.

* **Squash vs. Merge:**
  Many Conventional Commit workflows prefer **“squash and merge”** so that each PR results in exactly one Conventional Commit on `main`. Octo’s “merge” menu (`m`) lets you pick “Squash and merge” (key: `s`) or “Rebase and merge” (key: `r`). You can also rename the final squash-commit message before merging, ensuring it obeys `type(scope): desc`.

* **Automated Release PR Generation:**
  After merging your PR, Release-Please (configured as a GitHub Action) will:

  1. Parse all **Conventional Commit** messages on the `main` branch since the last release.
  2. Bump the version in `package.json` (or other manifest) automatically.
  3. Generate a new release PR (title: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`) with an updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
  4. Post it for your review as a GitHub PR.

  **Octo Integration Point:** When that Release PR appears, Octo will surface it under `:Octo pr list label:chore/release is:open`. You can open it (`Enter`), inspect the changelog diff in the “Files” view, and then `m s` (merge → squash) or `m m` (merge → merge commit), depending on how you want to record it.

---

## 3  Putting It All Together: “Issue → Commit → PR → Release”

Let’s walk through a concrete example of how you’d use **Neogit + Octo.nvim + Release-Please** in a single, unified flow.

> **Assumptions:**
>
> * You have set up a global `~/.gitmessage.txt` template for Conventional Commits.
> * You’ve added commitlint in your repo so that any `git commit` (even via Neogit) fails if the message is invalid.
> * You’ve configured a GitHub Action for [Release-Please](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) that runs when PRs are merged into `main`.
> * You’ve created GitHub labels: `type:feat`, `type:fix`, `release:patch`, `release:minor`, `release:major`.
> * Your CLI is authenticated with `gh auth login`, so Octo.nvim works without additional setup.

---

### 3.1  Step 1: Create a New Issue (Octo)

1. From any buffer, run:

   ```
   :Octo issue create
   ```
2. Octo opens a new buffer populated with your `~/.config/octo/issue_template.md`.

   ```markdown
   ### Description

   The API currently fails if `user.age` is a string. We need to cast it to an integer.

   ### Expected Commit Type
   # Choose one: feat, fix, chore
   ### Release Level
   # Choose one: patch, minor, major
   ```
3. You fill in:

   * **Title (e.g.,)** `bug: cast user.age to integer on input`
   * **Description:** “When user submits age field as a JSON string, the backend errors because it calls `age + 1`. We should coerce to integer before increments.”
   * Under **Expected Commit Type**, pick `fix`.
   * Under **Release Level**, pick `patch`.
4. Save & quit (`:wq`). Octo calls GitHub’s API and returns the new issue URL in a floating window.
5. Press `l` to open the label toggle window. Assign `type:fix` and `release:patch`.
6. Press `m` to assign a milestone (e.g., none yet, so skip).

Now you have a GitHub Issue `#234` (for instance), labeled `type:fix` and `release:patch`.

---

### 3.2  Step 2: Create a “fix/234-cast-user-age” Branch (Neogit)

1. In your local clone, run `:Neogit` to open the status buffer.
2. Press `b c` (branch → create). Because you set up the custom `create_branch_shell`, it prompts:

   ```
   Branch type (feat/fix/chore): fix
   Description: cast user age
   ```
3. Neogit creates and checks out branch `fix/cast-user-age` (or if you prefer including the issue number: `fix/234-cast-user-age`).

---

### 3.3  Step 3: Develop & Stage Hunks (Neogit + gitsigns)

1. Edit code so that `age` is cast to an integer:

   ```lua
   local age = tonumber(data.age) or 0
   ```
2. As you go, use `gitsigns` in normal mode:

   * Jump to changed lines → press `s` to stage those hunks immediately.
   * Or open `:Neogit` → see the “unstaged” section → move the cursor over a file → press `s` to stage that hunk.
3. Once all your changes are staged, press `c c` to commit.

---

### 3.4  Step 4: Write a Conventional Commit (Neogit Commit Buffer)

1. Press `:Neogit` → cursor on “staged files” ftw → `c c`.
2. Neogit opens your `COMMIT_EDITMSG` template in a split:

   ```text
   feat(parser): handle trailing commas

   # <type>(<scope>): <short description>
   # ...
   ```
3. You replace the top line with:

   ```
   fix(api): cast user.age to integer
   ```
4. In the body (optional), add `Closes #234` so GitHub auto-closes the issue.

   ```
   fix(api): cast user.age to integer

   Now if the frontend sends `"25"` as a string, we convert to 25. Closes #234
   ```
5. Save & quit (`:wq`).

   * The **commit-msg** hook (commitlint) checks that `fix(api): ...` is valid.
   * It passes, so the commit is recorded.

Because you included `Closes #234` in the commit body, GitHub will link this commit to issue #234 and close it once the branch is merged.

---

### 3.5  Step 5: Push & Create a PR (Neogit → Octo)

1. From Neogit’s status buffer, press `P` to push.

   * If `fix/cast-user-age` doesn’t exist on remote, it prompts “Push upstream?” Press `y`.
2. The branch is now on GitHub.
3. Open the PR creation menu in Octo:

   ```
   :Octo pr create
   ```
4. Octo asks:

   1. **Base**: `main` (default)
   2. **Head**: `username/fix/cast-user-age` (your branch)
   3. **Title**: prefilled with your branch name `fix/cast-user-age` → change it to:

      ```
      fix(api): cast user.age to integer
      ```
   4. **Description**: Octo’s template might include:

      ```markdown
      ### What it does
      <!-- Describe changes here (optional) -->

      ### Linked Issue
      Closes #234
      ```
   5. Save & quit. Octo calls GitHub’s API, and a new PR `fix(api): cast user.age to integer` appears.

---

### 3.6  Step 6: Review with Diffview (Optional)

* Run `:DiffviewOpen main...fix/cast-user-age` to visually verify exactly what’s changing.
* Scroll through side-by-side diffs, confirm that no extra lines got staged.
* Close with `:DiffviewClose` when satisfied.

---

### 3.7  Step 7: Merge the PR (Octo.nvim)

1. In Neovim, run:

   ```
   :Octo pr list involves:@me is:open
   ```
2. Find `fix(api): cast user.age to integer` in the list and press `Enter`. Octo opens the PR detail view.
3. Press `m` → Octo shows merge options:

   * `(s) Squash and merge`
   * `(m) Merge commit`
   * `(r) Rebase and merge`
   * `(q) Close without merge`
4. Choose `s` (squash), then Octo prompts to edit the final commit message. It prepopulates with:

   ```
   fix(api): cast user.age to integer

   Closes #234
   ```
5. Save & quit → the PR is merged into `main`. GitHub automatically closes issue #234 if it wasn’t already closed by the commit.

---

### 3.8  Step 8: Release-Please 🤝 GitHub Action

Your repository has a `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` that runs on merges to `main`:

```yaml
name: “Release Please”
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  release:
    name: Release Please
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Release Please
        uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v4
        with:
          release-type: node
          package-name: your-package
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

1. **On merging your `fix(api) …` PR**, the action triggers.
2. Release-Please scans all commits merged since the last release.

   * It sees `fix(api): cast user.age to integer` (type=fix, so bump “patch”).
3. It updates `package.json` → new version “1.2.3” (for example).
4. It appends a new `CHANGELOG.md` entry under “### Patch Changes.”
5. It opens a draft PR called `chore(release): 1.2.3` containing:

   * a bumped `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   * updated `CHANGELOG.md`
   * a new git tag `v1.2.3`.

---

### 3.9  Step 9: Review & Finalize Release PR (Octo.nvim)

1. Back in Neovim, run:

   ```
   :Octo pr list label:chore/release is:open
   ```

   (Release-Please typically labels its draft PR with `chore/release` or similar.)
2. Find `chore(release): 1.2.3` → press `Enter`.
3. Octo opens the release PR:

   * View files: confirm only `package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, etc., are modified.
   * Expand the commit body: it follows Conventional Commits (it’s named `chore(release): 1.2.3`).
4. Press `m` → choose how to merge. Many teams set “squash and merge” for release PRs, but “merge commit” is fine if you want to record a separate merge commit.
5. Once merged, GitHub automatically publishes a Release under **Tags** (`v1.2.3`) with your changelog.

At this point, your `main` branch is at `1.2.3`, and the entire flow—issue → commit → PR → automated release—happened without leaving the terminal.

---

## 4  Plugging Gaps & Tips for a Polished Workflow

1. **Automate Labeling Between Issue ↔ Commit ↔ PR**

   * You can write a small **GitHub Action** that, upon PR creation, checks the PR title prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.) and automatically applies `type:feat` or `type:fix` labels.
   * Similarly, when a PR is labeled `type:feat`, it can auto-assign `release:minor` (by project policy), or you can manually revise it in Octo.

2. **Use Milestones Strategically**

   * Create a “vX.Y.Z” milestone on GitHub and assign issues to that milestone directly from Octo (`m`).
   * When Release-Please runs, it can limit itself only to issues in that milestone—giving you finer control over which issues feed into each release.

3. **Telescope Shortcuts for Even Faster Context Switching**

   ```lua
   require('telescope').load_extension('octo')
   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>oi', function()
     require('telescope').extensions.octo.issues({ state = 'open', filter = 'involves:@me' })
   end)
   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>op', function()
     require('telescope').extensions.octo.pull_requests({ state = 'open', filter = 'involves:@me' })
   end)
   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>or', function()
     require('telescope').extensions.octo.pull_requests({ state = 'open', filter = 'label:chore/release' })
   end)
   ```

   * `<leader>oi`: Show *all open issues that involve you* (personal, org, work).
   * `<leader>op`: Show *all your open PRs*.
   * `<leader>or`: Show *all draft release PRs* (labelled `chore/release`).

4. **Enforce Branch Nam ing Programmatically**
   In your Neogit setup:

   ```lua
   require('neogit').setup {
     integrations = { diffview = true },
     -- Force user to pick a “type” when creating branch:
     branch = {
       create_branch_shell = function()
         local t = vim.fn.input("Commit type (feat/fix/chore): ")
         local desc = vim.fn.input("Short description (kebab-case): ")
         return string.format("%s/%s-%s", t, vim.fn.expand("%:t:r"), desc)
       end
     }
   }
   ```

   * If you’re in `my-cool-plugin` repo, and you run `:Neogit` → `b c`, it might prompt:

     ```
     Commit type (feat/fix/chore): feat
     Short description (kebab-case): dynamic-theme-support
     → branch = feat/my-cool-plugin-dynamic-theme-support
     ```

   This ties the repo name into the branch for extra clarity.

5. **Project Board Card Automation**

   * On GitHub, configure automations so that when an issue is labeled `in progress` (you can label it from Octo), it moves from “To Do” → “In Progress” on your project board.
   * When it’s closed (Octo merges the PR), it auto-moves from “In Progress” → “Done.” This ensures your project board visually matches exactly what’s happening in Neovim.

## 5  Why This Combination (Neogit + Octo) “Just Works”

| Concern                            | Neogit                                                                                                                                         | Octo.nvim                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enforcing Conventional Commits** | Opens your `commit.template` automatically; works with `commit-msg` hooks (commitlint) to reject bad messages.                                 | N/A for local commits, but you can set PR‐template rules to enforce Conventional Commit titles.                                                                            |
| **Branch Naming Discipline**       | Custom `create_branch_shell` prompt lets you prefix with `feat/`, `fix/`.                                                                      | When creating a PR, head branch name suggests the commit type.                                                                                                             |
| **Local Diff / Review**            | `:DiffviewOpen` to inspect exactly what you’ll merge.                                                                                          | Octo’s “Review Changes” shows file diffs in the PR, but Diffview is superior for local side-by-side.                                                                       |
| **Issue <→ Commit Linkage**        | You type `Closes #123` in commit body. Neogit doesn’t autocomplete, but once merged, GitHub closes it.                                         | Octo can automatically populate `Closes #123` in PR description, and you can toggle linked issues visually.                                                                |
| **PR Creation & Review**           | **N/A**—Neogit doesn’t create PRs. You’d have to run `gh pr create` manually.                                                                  | `:Octo pr create` spins up a full PR form. Title, body, link issues, labels, reviewers, all from one buffer.                                                               |
| **Merge Strategy**                 | `m s` / `m r` / `m m` (squash, rebase, merge) all available via Neogit or Octo.                                                                | When in a PR, pressing `m` lets you choose “Squash and merge,” “Rebase,” etc.                                                                                              |
| **Changelog & Tags**               | You can create the release commit and tag locally. But often you rely on GitHub Action.                                                        | When your release PR is generated (by Release-Please), you see it as a normal PR (`label:chore/release`). Merge it via Octo, and GitHub publishes the tag + Release notes. |
| **Multi-Org, Multi-Repo**          | Each repo is local—you open different Neovim instances or sessions per repo. No “global view” of all branches, but you can `:cd` between them. | `:Octo issue list involves:@me` fetches across all your repos & orgs. You never need to change directories to see your open issues.                                        |

Because **Neogit** and **Octo** each do one “side” of the workflow extremely well, you end up with:

1. **A bulletproof, in-editor Conventional Commit process** (Neogit + hooks + templates)
2. **A GitHub-native, in-editor Issue & PR management system** (Octo)
3. **Automated releases** triggered by merges (Release-Please action on GitHub)

…all connected by **“Conventional Commit conventions”** and a **consistent labeling/milestone scheme** that both Neogit (commit messages) and Octo (issues/PRs) understand.

## 6  Example “Full-Flow” Cheat Sheet

Below is a step-by-step “cheat sheet” summary. Keep this pinned in your dotfiles:

````text
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Gh CLI login (once)

   $ gh auth login
   (Now Octo.nvim has permission to list/edit issues/PRs)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Create a new Issue (tracked on GitHub)

   :Octo issue create
   → Fill in:
     • Title: "<type>(<scope>): <short description>"
       e.g., "feat(ui): add night mode switch"
     • Body: Describe, then pick Expected Commit Type & Release Level
     • Save → GitHub issue #XYZ created
   → Press 'l', assign labels: type:feat, release:minor
   → Press 'm', optionally tag milestone (e.g. "v2.0.0")

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Branch off “main” with correct prefix (Neogit)

   :Neogit →  (b) → (c)
   [ prompt ] Commit type (feat/fix/chore): feat
   [ prompt ] Short description (kebab-case): night-mode-switch
   → Branch = feat/night-mode-switch

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Code & Stage Changes

   • Make your code edits.
   • Use gitsigns hunk staging (s / u) or
   :Neogit → highlight file → press 's' to stage.
   • Once ready → :Neogit → (c) → (c) → open commit buffer.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Write Conventional Commit (Neogit)

   In COMMIT_EDITMSG (from ~/.gitmessage.txt):
     ```
     feat(ui): add night mode switch

     - Toggle between light and dark themes.
     - Update CSS variables.
     - Closes #XYZ
     ```
   • Save & quit (:wq).  
   • commit-msg hook (commitlint) validates format or errors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.  Push and Create PR

   :Neogit → (P) → push branch upstream.
   :Octo pr create
   → Base: main
     Head: feat/night-mode-switch
     Title: prefilled "feat/night-mode-switch" → change to:
       "feat(ui): add night mode switch"
     Body: 
       ```
       #### What
       Adds a toggle to switch to dark theme.

       #### Linked Issue
       Closes #XYZ
       ```
   → Save → PR #456 is now open.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7.  Review with Diffview (Optional)

   :DiffviewOpen main...feat/night-mode-switch
   • Inspect side-by-side.  
   :DiffviewClose when done.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8.  Merge the PR (Squash & Merge)

   :Octo pr list involves:@me is:open
   • Select PR #456 → press (m) → choose (s) “Squash and merge”  
   → Edit the final message (pre-populated by PR’s title/body):
     ```
     feat(ui): add night mode switch

     Closes #XYZ
     ```
   → Save → Merge.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9.  Release-Please Automated Bump

   (GitHub Action triggers on merge to main)
   • Scans commit history: sees "feat(ui): add night mode switch" → bump minor (x):
     v1.2.0 → v1.3.0
   • Generates `chore(release): v1.3.0` PR with updated CHANGELOG.md  
     (Lists all “feat(…)” and “fix(…)” since v1.2.0)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
10. Review & Merge Release PR

    :Octo pr list label:chore/release is:open
    • Open “chore(release): v1.3.0” → press (m) → choose (m) “Merge”
    • GitHub publishes Release v1.3.0 with CHANGELOG notes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
11. Celebrate 🎉

## 7  Final Thoughts & Next Steps

* **Octo.nvim** gives you **issue/PR UI** deep enough to:

  * Filter by label (`type:feat`, `release:patch`)
  * Assign issues to milestones/projects (so Release-Please knows which issues feed which release)
  * Author PRs whose titles are already in Conventional Commit format.
  * Review and merge release PRs.

* **Neogit** ensures your **local Git work** (branch creation, staging, commits) is 100% Conventional Commit-compliant (via `commit.template` and hooks), and it sets you up perfectly for Release-Please to parse everything.

* **Release-Please** (external action) then automates the final step—generating a `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` PR and a GitHub Release.

Putting them together, you get a **terminal-centric**, **Neovim-native** workflow that goes from “I have an idea” → “I open an issue” → “I code on a branch” → “I commit in Proper Conventional Commit style” → “I PR” → “I merge” → “I automatically get a new release.” All without opening a browser (except maybe to view your Projects board if you want the full Kanban view).

# first draft of git utility belt

I am working on a project called "git utility belt" which is effectively a set pof "old school pre ai" dev automations. today we are adding  a layer of llm automations using a part of the openhands feature set. i have access to 50 credits

the protocol so far:

```
# Git Utility Belt: Standardized Workflow for Projects

I've compiled a comprehensive summary of the standardized GitHub workflow we've developed - a "Git Utility Belt" that can be applied consistently across all your projects.

## Core Philosophy

This approach creates a professional, GitHub-centric workflow that:
- Requires minimal local configuration (no local npm installs needed)
- Leverages GitHub's cloud infrastructure for automation
- Maintains high standards for versioning, documentation, and project management
- Works well for solo developers or small teams

## Key Components

### 1. Automated Versioning & Releases

We've chosen **release-please** (Google's tool) over semantic-release because:
- It runs entirely on GitHub's servers with no local installation needed
- It automatically determines version increments based on conventional commits
- It creates beautiful changelogs with proper issue/PR linking
- It manages pre-release versions (alpha/beta) effectively

### 2. Commit Standards

We're using GitHub's built-in semantic commit enforcement via `.github/semantic.yml` rather than local commit hooks because:
- It avoids the need for local husky/commitlint installations
- It enforces standards at the PR level rather than locally
- It provides a consistent experience across environments

### 3. Project Structure

The workflow includes standardized documentation:
- `docs/PROJECT-README.md` - Project vision and context
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and components
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` - Roadmap aligned with semantic versions
- `docs/RETROSPECTIVE.md` - Learning and process improvements

### 4. Issue Management

The approach includes:
- Structured templates for bugs, features, and investigations
- A consistent labeling system (type, status, priority)
- Milestone planning aligned with semantic versions
- PR templates that enforce linking to issues

### 5. Solo-Agile Workflow

For maintainable momentum as a solo developer:
- Weekly planning (select 3-5 issues from active milestone)
- Daily progress notes
- Friday reviews (update milestone progress)
- Monthly retrospectives

## Repository Structure

├── README.md                        # Quick start guide
└── CONTRIBUTING.md                  # Contribution guidelines
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Cloud-First Approach**: Leverage GitHub's infrastructure rather than local tools
2. **Documentation as Code**: Version-controlled docs paired with code
3. **Schema-Driven Development**: When applicable, use schemas as the source of truth
4. **Milestone-Driven Planning**: Structure work around semantic versions
5. **Minimalist Local Setup**: No complex local configuration needed

## Practical Implementation

To implement this across projects:
1. Create a template repository with all these components
2. For each new project, clone the template or copy the `.github` directory
3. Set up the required GitHub repository settings
4. Configure initial milestones aligned with semantic versions

This standardized approach will help you maintain professional quality across multiple concurrent projects while minimizing the cognitive overhead of different workflows for each project.
