## What is AIcademy?

This is my personal documentation of learning to code with AI assistance.

TODO:
sitemap includes
- claude gh action explainer (and why @claude cannot be controlled from octo.nvim)
- gh oldschool automations
- repo files (wiki, claude.md is all you need)
- documentation as code back and forth
- advanced: nvim setup
