After 2 years I've finally cracked the code on avoiding these infinite loops. Here's what actually works:

1. The 3-Strike Rule (aka "Stop Digging, You Idiot")

If AI fails to fix something after 3 attempts, STOP. Just stop. I learned this after watching my codebase grow from 2,000 lines to 18,000 lines trying to fix a dropdown menu. The AI was literally wrapping my entire app in try-catch blocks by the end.

What to do instead:

Screenshot the broken UI

Start a fresh chat session

Describe what you WANT, not what's BROKEN

Let AI rebuild that component from scratch

2. Context Windows Are Not Your Friend

Here's the dirty secret - after about 10 back-and-forth messages, the AI starts forgetting what the hell you're even building. I once had Claude convinced my AI voice platform was a recipe blog because we'd been debugging the persona switching feature for so long.

My rule: Every 8-10 messages, I:

Save working code to a separate file

Start fresh

Paste ONLY the relevant broken component

Include a one-liner about what the app does

This cut my debugging time by ~70%.

3. The "Explain Like I'm Five" Test

If you can't explain what's broken in one sentence, you're already screwed. I spent 6 hours once because I kept saying "the data flow is weird and the state management seems off but also the UI doesn't update correctly sometimes."

Now I force myself to say things like:

"Button doesn't save user data"

"Page crashes on refresh"

"Image upload returns undefined"

Simple descriptions = better fixes.

4. Version Control Is Your Escape Hatch

Git commit after EVERY working feature. Not every day. Not every session. EVERY. WORKING. FEATURE.

I learned this after losing 3 days of work because I kept "improving" working code until it wasn't working anymore. Now I commit like a paranoid squirrel hoarding nuts for winter.

My commits from last week:

42 total commits

31 were rollback points

11 were actual progress

0 lost features

5. The Nuclear Option: Burn It Down

Sometimes the code is so fucked that fixing it would take longer than rebuilding. I had to nuke our entire voice personality management system three times before getting it right.

If you've spent more than 2 hours on one bug:

Copy your core business logic somewhere safe

Delete the problematic component entirely

Tell AI to build it fresh with a different approach

Usually takes 20 minutes vs another 4 hours of debugging

The infinite loop isn't an AI problem - it's a human problem of being too stubborn to admit when something's irreversibly broken.
